# Methods for prediction using high dimensional data

Some methods I applied to predict new test data.

There were two problems, one for predicting water flow and rainfall - a regression problem;
and another for classifying handwritten digits - a classical classification problem.

Both were done in R, including the deep neural network using python, tensorflow and keras.

The models include:
- Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Lasso
- Random Forests
- Deep Neural Network

For the regression task, run master.R in sao_francisco folder.
For the classification task, run master.R in digits folder.
